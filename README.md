# Typescript Bus Board project

Finds nearby bus stations and their incoming buses
From command line use Print Buses [stopcode] to view the next five buses arriving at the given stop
Find Near [postcode] gives the nearest two stops and their next five buses

Also hosts an api on localhost:3000/closestStops, given a postcode will return a JSON object of the two closest stops and their next five buses
Includes index.html which demonstrates use of this api
